PIC16F84 compatible microprocessor with three-stage pipeline.
The pipeline stages are: instruction fetch, decode and execute.

This project is a microprocessor core aiming to be compatible with Microchips 
pic16f84 microprocessor.

Things that don't work yet:
- Programming (in-circuit low voltage programming)
- Eeprom
- Sleep, watchdog

Eeprom won't be implemented due to lack of eeprom in FPGAs.
Sleep is also not very useful with FPGA because the clock cannot be shutdown,
but I might implement it anyways for compatibility reasons.
