PIC16F84 compatible microprocessor.

This project is a microprocessor aiming to be compatible with Microchips 
pic16f84 microprocessor.

Things that work:
- All of the instruction except for:
  clrwdt (clear watchdog timer)
  sleep (disable oscillator, go into sleep state)
- Inputs and outputs. Configuring, reading and writing.

What doesn't
- Some of the special purpose registers (peripheral related register)
- Programming (Run time low voltage programming)
- Sleep, watchdog, interrupts

Bugs:
- Call, return, goto take 1 clock cycle instead of 2
