PIC16F84 compatible microprocessor.

This project is a microprocessor aiming to be compatible with Microchips 
pic16f84 microprocessor.

Things that work:
- Most of the instructions (all arithmetic, bit set/clear, branches, call and returns work)
- Writing to general purpose RAM

What doesn't
- Some of the special purpose registers (PCL and STATUS work)
- Programming (Run time low voltage programming)
- Sleep, watchdog, interrupts, timer
